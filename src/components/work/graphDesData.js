        info:<div>In this project I, together with my team, decided to dive deep into Stockholm's top travel app - SL, with the goal to find new design solutions for the new problems that have occurred due to corona. The project was centered around the question 
            “How can technology be used to minimize physical interaction?”. Technical tools used was Miro, for the discover and define phase, and Figma and Marvel for the develop and deliver phase. User research was made firstly through surveys for quantitative 
            data collection, and later through in-depth-interviews for qualitative data. Different personas were also created to test the design. In the development phase, both hand-drawn low-fi sketches and later, digital high-fi sketches were used. In the delivery phase, both a prototype 
            (<a href="https://marvelapp.com/prototype/baf0iig/screen/73760598">check it out here!</a>) and a workbook was created:

The course consists of students in master programs in computer science and I am the Art Director. In my role, I am in charge of many different design processes. These include designing the UI for our mobile app, find good ways to visualize data for our feedback-reports, and also creating content for our social channels. The work is for the most part done in InDesign, Illustrator and Figma.
