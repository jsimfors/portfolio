        info:<div>I am a teaching assistant in the courses <i>SF1624 Algebra & Geometry</i> and <i>SF1626 Multivariable Calculus</i> at the Department of Mathematics at KTH. That includes teaching classes and holding seminars for other students at KTH, for group as big as 100 students at the time. (There's usuall a maximum at around how many can fit in a classroom, but due to covid-19, I've held my classes in Zoom and Photoshop, and more students have been able to attend, yay!) I also share material with my students, such as my notes and formula-sheets, through my page linked below.</div>,
